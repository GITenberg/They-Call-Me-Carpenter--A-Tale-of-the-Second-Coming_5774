description: Although Sinclair had written very critically of organized religion in
  his book The Profits of Religion, in this novel he takes a more human approach to
  the story of Christ. Of course, the Christ character is repulsed by the show of
  wealth he finds in 1920s California culture, which ultimately contributes to his
  leaving. In that sense, They Call Me Carpenter fits well into the canon of Upton
  Sinclair.
